This project predicts the streams based on many features, including danceability%, in spotify charts, energy%, and more. Analysis is found in the jupyter notebook file, along with the equation found to find how many streams a song would have (coefficients were found). Data was charted and graphed, along with the importance of the features using Random Forest. Predictions found using Linear Regression.
